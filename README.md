> [!WARNING]
> This repository is a work-in-progress fork of Hermex. It is replacing the app's dependency on the separate [`hermes-webui`](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui) service with the native Hermes Agent dashboard and gateway. The migration is incomplete; features and documentation below may still describe the upstream WebUI-backed release. Backend connectivity was ported and adapted from [Hermes Conduit](https://github.com/kaishi00/hermes-conduit) by [kaishi00](https://github.com/kaishi00), under its MIT License.

Hermex is a native SwiftUI iPhone app for driving a self-hosted [hermes-webui](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui) server — a mobile cockpit for an AI agent that lives on a machine **you** control. The phone is the control plane, not the compute plane: the agent, its tools, and your data stay on your own hardware.

- **Free.** No subscriptions, no in-app purchases.
- **Private.** No analytics, no tracking, no third-party relay — the app talks only to your server.
- **Native.** Real SwiftUI, built for iOS 18+, not a web wrapper.

## Features

- **Chat with your agent** — send messages with model, reasoning-effort, workspace, and profile options; attach files and images; watch responses stream in real time with thinking and tool-call detail.
- **Steer or stop a run** mid-flight.
- **Sessions** — browse, search, and resume every conversation on your server; cached sessions stay readable offline.
- **Pick your models** — switch between any model or provider your server is configured for, with recents and favorites.
- **Profiles & projects** — switch agent profiles and organize sessions into projects.
- **Tasks** — view and edit your agent's scheduled cron jobs from your phone.
- **Skills** — browse and search the agent's installed skills.
- **Workspace browser** — explore your server's file system from the app.
- **Memory & Insights** — read-only panels for agent memory and usage analytics.

## Getting started

Hermex is a client only — it does not ship with, host, or provision a backend. You bring your own [hermes-webui](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui) server (a third-party, MIT-licensed open-source project) running on a machine you control. Setup takes about 15 minutes:

1. **Run the server.** Install and start `hermes-webui` on macOS, Linux, or Windows/WSL2 (Python 3.11+). Set `HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD`.
2. **Make it reachable from your phone** (see options below).
3. **Connect.** [Download Hermex](https://apps.apple.com/app/hermex/id6767006319), enter your server URL (e.g. `https://hermes.yourdomain.com`) and password, and you're in.

Self-hosting the server, securing it, and keeping it reachable are your responsibility.

### Making the server reachable

- **HTTPS via a tunnel or reverse proxy (recommended).** Expose the server through Cloudflare Tunnel or any reverse proxy that terminates real TLS at a hostname you own. Real HTTPS keeps iOS App Transport Security happy with no exceptions. On a publicly reachable hostname the password is your only app-level defense — set a strong one.
- **Private HTTPS with Tailscale Serve.** Keep the server password-protected and bound to `127.0.0.1:8787`, inspect existing Serve/Funnel routes, then add `tailscale serve --bg 8787` only when HTTPS port 443 at the root path is free. Install Tailscale on the iPhone and connect with the exact `https://…ts.net` URL reported by `tailscale serve status`. Direct binding to `0.0.0.0` over plain HTTP remains a manual fallback, not the default.
- **Simulator-only local testing** can use `http://localhost:8787` when the server runs on the same Mac.

### Troubleshooting the connection

If connection testing fails, check these first:

1. The machine hosting `hermes-webui` is awake.
2. `hermes-webui` is running and serving `/health` (`curl https://<your-server>/health`).
3. The tunnel, reverse proxy, or Tailscale route is connected.
4. The server URL and password are correct.

## Building from source

Prefer the [App Store build](https://apps.apple.com/app/hermex/id6767006319) unless you're developing. To build yourself you need Xcode 26 or newer (iOS 18 SDK) and an iPhone or simulator on iOS 18+.

Clone the repo, open `HermesMobile.xcodeproj`, and run the `HermesMobile` scheme on an iPhone simulator (the Xcode target is `HermesMobile`; the app's display name is `Hermex`). Dependencies are resolved automatically via Swift Package Manager.

From the command line:

```zsh
xcodebuild -project HermesMobile.xcodeproj -scheme HermesMobile -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' build
```

```zsh
xcodebuild test -project HermesMobile.xcodeproj -scheme HermesMobile -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'
```

If that simulator is not installed, list available devices and choose a nearby iPhone simulator:

```zsh
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

Local validation defaults for XcodeBuildMCP users live in `.xcodebuildmcp/config.yaml`; the standard post-change flow is in [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Server compatibility

The app is developed and tested against the `hermes-webui` commit pinned in [`UPSTREAM_TESTED_SHA`](UPSTREAM_TESTED_SHA). Upstream does not yet guarantee API stability (its README declares version skew unsupported pending their stable-API work), so newer or older server versions may break individual features — please include your server version in bug reports. The app decodes tolerantly (unknown fields never crash it) and endpoint shapes are verified against upstream source, never invented; see [`CONTRACT_TESTS.md`](CONTRACT_TESTS.md) for the contract-testing approach.

## Contributing

- Do not invent API endpoints or JSON shapes; verify against the upstream server source or a running server.
- Every `Codable` model decodes tolerantly — never crash on unknown fields.
- Add no third-party dependencies beyond the locked list in `PROJECT_SPEC.md` without explicit approval.
- Do not modify the upstream `hermes-webui` server from this repo.
